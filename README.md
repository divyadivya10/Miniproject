## Title of the Project
Stroke Prediction End-to-End Machine Learning Using Flask and React

## About
Stroke Prediction System is an end-to-end project designed to leverage machine learning models for predicting the likelihood of a stroke in individuals based on various health parameters. This project uses Flask for the backend, which processes input data and runs the machine learning model, while React is used for building the user-friendly front-end interface. The system aims to provide a quick and accurate prediction tool that can help in early detection, allowing individuals to seek medical intervention before a potential stroke occurs.

## Features
Machine Learning Model: A predictive model built using popular algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machine to analyze health data and predict stroke risk.
Real-Time Prediction: Integration of a real-time prediction interface that provides results instantly after user data input.
User-friendly Front-end: Developed using React, enabling a responsive and interactive user experience.
Scalable: Capable of handling large datasets and user requests efficiently.
Data Visualization: Provides visual representations of predictions, results, and insights to users.
API Integration: Flask is used to serve the machine learning model and manage interactions between the front-end and back-end.
Customizable Model: Users can adjust the model parameters for different levels of prediction accuracy or apply new datasets.
Requirements
Operating System: Windows 10/Ubuntu or any OS that supports Python 3.6 or later.
Backend Development: Python 3.6 or later with Flask framework for API development.
Frontend Development: React.js (for building the user interface).
Machine Learning Frameworks: Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.
Web Development Tools: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (for frontend components).
Data Science Libraries: Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation; Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Version Control: Git for managing project code and collaboration.
IDE: VSCode or any other suitable IDE for both backend and frontend development.
Other Dependencies: Flask, React, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, axios (for API calls).

Output2 - 

Accuracy: 92.3% (This metric is based on the performance of the machine learning model after testing on a validation set)

## Results and Impact
The Stroke Prediction System enables users to assess their risk of stroke based on personal health data, thereby offering a proactive approach to stroke prevention. The integration of machine learning with web technologies like Flask and React allows for seamless interaction between the back-end prediction model and front-end user interface, enhancing user experience.

This system can be used by healthcare providers, patients, and individuals to monitor and reduce the risks of stroke through early detection. It opens up possibilities for further development in predictive health tools that can help in diagnosing and preventing other health-related conditions.

The project demonstrates the power of combining machine learning with modern web technologies to create scalable and interactive health applications.
